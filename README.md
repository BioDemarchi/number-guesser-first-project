<h1> Number Guesser </h1>
<strong><h3> My first ever little project using python </h3></strong>

<p> I created this little game in order to learn a bit more about how functions and loops work in python, it took me around two and a bit hours to get everything going. I did use forums like stackoverflow and w3schools for most of it, also a bit of help from visual code. With this project I mostly wanted to study the logic behind python and it's commands so I can become a better programmer.</p>

<p> If you would like to try it out you can just donwload and use your prefered python compiler or if you are using the github terminal just write "python numberguesser.py"</p>
<p> Thank you for looking at this, would love some constructive feedback!</p>
